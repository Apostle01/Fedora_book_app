## Testing

Testing was continuous throughout the website build. I used Chrome developer tools to identify and address any issues as they arose.

My automated testing consisted of using W3C Validator, Lighthouse, Wave, and the CI Linter Python.
I then manually tested the user stories along with the functionality of the website.
Automated Testing
W3C Validator
W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

All pages pass the W3C validator.

Lighthouse Testing
I took the opportunity to utilize Lighthouse within Chrome Developer Tools. This allowed me to test for performance, accessibility, best practices, and the SEO (search engine optimization) of the website.

All pages pass Googleâ€™s Lighthouse tests for Desktop and Mobile.

### User Testing Summary

On the whole ReelTalk is an engaging, user-friendly website that sucessfully meets the needs of movie lovers by providing a centralized community for sharing and discovering movie reviews. ReelTalk offers a comprehensive, up-to-date movie database by leveraging the TMDB database, this enhances the user's ability to search for and review films. The website focuses on user-generated content, providing a perspective from everyday moviegoers rather than relying on professional critics. Users can easily navigate the site, manage their reviews and enjoy a personalised experience, thanks to the websites accessible and intuitive interface. Security features such as authentications and authorization ensure the users can safely manage their own content. 

Whether you're a first time visitor, returning user or a frequent reviewer, ReelTalk offers a tailored experience that meets the needs of it's target audience. Which I believe makes the website a success and meets all of the initial goals set prior to creating the website.

| 1 | The release date for each book returned from the API is in US format. The date is used on each of the book cards across the website. Eventually I would like to rectify the issue by converting the dates to UK format to match the review created date |
